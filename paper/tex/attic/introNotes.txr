-Interested in answering the question: does climate limit the growth of chestnut oak in a closed canopy mixedwood forest? 
-Bring in a bunch of lit that talks about closed canopy climate signals, see: Peters et al 1981; Speer et al. 2009; in particular, there is a diagram in Fritts et al. 1965 that shows the idea of this that we should recreate - i can draw this if we want to include this
