<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >In a closed-canopy forest, stand dynamics play an important role in shaping the forest, and it has been
hypothesized that dense forests are not sufficiently limited by climate to warrant climate reconstruction.
We collected <span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-109">Quercus prinus </span>tree-ring data from a dense forest in the Appalachians, and
after removal of stand dynamics and age trends we find strong correlations between annual
tree growth and early summer precipitation. To strengthen the climate signal, we include
additional southeastern US <span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-109">Quercus prinus </span>chronologies in a nested principal component analysis
(PCA). Correlation between the growth proxy and early summer precipitation was increased
through PCA, and assessment of reconstruction skill was favorable. The reconstruction was
modeled using a Bayesian regression model, which allowed uncertainty to be quantified. The
reconstruction covered the period 1750-1981, and extended the instrumental record by 150
years. The reconstruction showed key drought years identified by others, as well as 11-year
periodicity.

<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >The Southern Appalachian region is one of the most biologically diverse temperate forest systems. This
region has supported continuous forest communities longer than any other area on the North American
continent, and hosts many rare, endemic species [<a 
href="#XNCNHP2012">1</a>]. Additionally, it harbors many disjunct species
populations. The southern Appalachians also provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage,
watershed and water quality protection, and serve as a timber source [<a 
href="#Xzipper2011restoring">2</a>]. In order to protect these
valuable resources, it is crucial that we understand the past climate of this area and how it has
influenced the many ecosystems within the region. Understanding this past climate-ecosystem
relationship will enable scientists and landowners to better manage natural resources in a our current
changing climate.
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >Global circulation models project an increase in average global surface temperatures of <span 
class="pplr9t-x-x-109">1.0 </span><span 
class="zplmr7y-x-x-109">- </span><span 
class="pplr9t-x-x-109">3.5</span><sup><span

the end of this century due to continued increases in greenhouse-gas emissions [<a 
href="#Xpachauri2007climate">3</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xkattenberg1996climate">4</a>]. However the
influence of increased radiative forcing on precipitation regimes is not well understood, and this is
particularly the case for the southeastern United States (US). The 24 models used to make predictions
about climate change in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report
were not in consensus with respect to drought frequency in this region [<a 
href="#Xpachauri2007climate">3</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xseager2009drought">5</a>]. Uncertainty in climate
projections makes it difficult to predict water and power usage. The ability to do so is crucial because
the southeastern US has experienced substantial increases in population and energy consumption, over
the last decade [<a 
href="#Xseager2009drought">5</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xsobolowski2012evaluation">6</a>]. It is important that the public and planners in the Southeast have access
to information regarding climate change projections and mitigation. Through the use of
tree-ring based climate reconstructions, we can better understand past precipitation regimes at
both decadal- and centennial time-scales and improve projections of future precipitation
patterns.
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >In order to reduce uncertainty in climate model projections and to extend meteorological records further
back in time, tree-ring data are commonly used as regional proxies, particularly in regions where
drought (e.g. the American Southwest, [<a 
href="#Xcook2004long">7</a>]) or summer temperature (e.g. the European Alps, [<a 
href="#Xbuntgen2007growth">8</a>]) is the
limiting tree growth factor. However, tree-ring data have also successfully been used for climate
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
reconstructions in the eastern US [<a 
href="#Xleblanc1993temporal">9</a>&#8211;<a 
href="#Xcook1999drought">11</a>]. Traditionally it has been understood that trees in a
closed-canopy forest are not limited by climate to the same extent as trees growing on the forest border
[<a 
href="#Xfritts1976tree">12</a>]. Within a dense forest, stand dynamics play an important role in shaping the forest
structure through their influence on radial tree growth and tree survival. As these interactions
between individuals increase in strength, the climatic influence on tree growth becomes less
dominant.
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >Trees growing in temperate regions characterized by high humidity, such as those in the Southeast US,
are typically thought to be less sensitive to climate than trees in semiarid regions [<a 
href="#Xphipps1982comments">13</a>]. This belief
supports the idea that the degree to which an environmental factor is limiting affects the amount of
variability in that factor that is seen in tree-ring time series.
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >Despite the challenges of finding a strong climate signal in tree-ring time series in southeastern US
forests, numerous studies have identified climate-growth correlations [<a 
href="#Xpan1997dendroclimatological">14</a>&#8211;<a 
href="#Xrubino2000dendroclimatological">16</a>]. For example, Pan
et&#x00A0;al.&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#Xpan1997dendroclimatological">14</a>] showed that after tree-ring standardization, both annual ring-width and basal area
increments of four deciduous species in Virginia were positively correlated with precipitation from both
the prior summer, autumn, and current summer. They also report negative correlations with air
temperature of the current growing season. Speer et&#x00A0;al.&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#Xspeer2009climate">15</a>] found similar correlations between
precipitation and temperature and annual tree growth for oak chronologies from closed canopy forests
in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.
<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >In this study, we determine the presence of a significant relationship between chestnut oak growth series
in the eastern US and early summer precipitation and ascertain the viability of a climatic reconstruction
based on the chestnut oak growth series as proxy data. The annual growth proxy data was
subsequently used to reconstruct early summer precipitation using Bayesian methods. Finally,
we evaluated the reliability of the reconstruction by comparing it to other verified regional
reconstructions.

href="#x1-120051">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:map --></a>). This
region is classified as either humid continental or mountain temperate, and characterized by warm,
humid summers and winters that are predominantly cool with intermittent warm spells. The mean
annual precipitation from 1901-2010 at the nearby Blacksburg weather station was 1073 mm, while the
mean annual temperature was <span

class="zplmr7m-x-x-109">C</span>.
<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >The study site supported older chestnut oak (<span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-109">Quercus prinus</span>) trees amongst a canopy of
many species, including scarlet oak (<span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-109">Quercus coccinea</span>), northern red oak (<span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-109">Quercus rubra</span>), red
maple (<span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-109">Acer rubrum</span>), Virginia pine (<span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-109">Pinus virginiana</span>), pitch pine (<span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-109">Pinus pungens</span>), and eastern
white pine (<span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-109">Pinus strobus</span>). Site access was adjacent to the Appalachian trail, although the
site was selected to minimize human interference. The steepness of this slope suggested
that climate may be a limiting growth factor, although the closed canopy and stand density
suggested that stand dynamics may also play a significant role in shaping the forest structure
[<a 
href="#Xfritts1976tree">12</a>].
<!--l. 111--><p class="noindent" >We sampled 56 chestnut oak trees and collected two increment cores per tree. Samples were dried,
mounted, and sanded according to standard procedure [<a 
href="#Xstokes1996introduction">17</a>]. Crossdating was performed using reflected
light microscopy and the list method, which facilitates the identification of marker years that signify
relatively favorable or unfavorable growth years in a stand [<a 
href="#Xyamaguchi1991simple">18</a>]. All samples were measured using a
LINTAB measurement stage with 0.01mm precision, and visual crossdating was checked using
COFECHA [<a 
href="#Xholmes1983computer">19</a>]. We used inter-series correlation, a measure of stand-level signal, and mean
sensitivity, to select a total of 76 tree-ring series from 53 trees to be used for site chronology
development.
<!--l. 123--><p class="noindent" >Non-climatic age and stand dynamics related trends were removed from the individual tree-ring series
using smoothing splines with a 50 % cutoff at 50 years using ARSTAN software [<a 
href="#Xcook1997calculating">20</a>]. This method
allowed us the flexibility to remove the episodic-like interaction effects from the time series, while
retaining the high-frequency climatic variability. Note that as with any filtering technique, inevitably
some portion of the climatic signal will be lost through the removal of these non-climatic trends [<a 
href="#Xcook1981smoothing">21</a>]. We
here assume that the loss of climatic signal was negligible, and comparison of the detrended time series
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
with climatic data ultimately determined if the strength of the remaining signal was sufficient to
perform further analyses. The Brush Mountain site chronology was then developed based on the
individually detrended tree-ring width time series, and will hereafter be referred to as BM.
<!--l. 148--><p class="noindent" >We also computed the expressed population signal (EPS) to measure the common variability in our
chronology at an annual resolution. EPS depends on both signal coherence and annual sample-depth,
and EPS values which fall below a predetermined cutoff (0.85) indicate that the chronology is not
dominated by a coherent signal, and is therefore deemed less than ideal for climatic reconstructions
[<a

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-50002.2"></a>Principal component analysis</h4>
<!--l. 159--><p class="noindent" >Although water access may not be limiting in southeastern US sites, a large sample size may
compensate to help identify the common climate signals despite site and individual variability. In
regions that are subject to site heterogeneity, where significant climatic variance cannot be
identified for a standard sample size, principal component analysis can be an effective means to
overcome the lack of strength of climate signal [<a 
href="#Xpeters1981principal">25</a>&#8211;<a 
href="#Xjacoby1989reconstructed">27</a>]. Through the application of principal
component analysis (PCA), tree-ring data collected from a network of regional sites can be
combined to reduce site level noise through the identification of a common climate signal across
sites.
<!--l. 178--><p class="noindent" >Tree-ring data from 8 eastern US <span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-109">Quercus prinus </span>sites were downloaded from the International
Tree-Ring Database (ITRDB; <a 
href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/treering.html" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1095">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/treering.html</span></a>) and were
considered for inclusion in a PCA analysis. For each of the eight sites, individual ring-width
time series were detrended using a smoothing spline with 50% cutoff at 50 years [<a 
href="#Xcook1981smoothing">21</a>], and
subsequently used to develop site chronologies. Chronology reliability for each of the 8 chronologies
was assessed based on the mean sensitivity, inter-series correlation, EPS, and the first-order
autocorrelation. Furthermore, only chronologies which extended back to at least 1845 (the length of
the BM chronology) and significantly correlated with regional precipitation anomalies (see
below) were retained for further analysis. Four <span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-109">Quercus </span>tree-ring chronologies (3 <span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-109">Quercus</span>
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-109">prinus </span>and 1 <span

href="#x1-120062">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:stackedChrons --></a>), and all covered the time
interval 1845-1981, while some extended further back in time. To make use of the of the
chronology lengths which extended to years prior to 1845, chronologies were combined with
the BM chronology in a nested singular value decomposition PCA [<a 
href="#Xwold1987principal">28</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xcook2007north">29</a>]. The first PCA
included 5 contributing chronologies that covered the 1845-1981 time interval, while the second
PCA included 3 contributing chronologies that covered the 1750-1981 time interval. In each
PCA, the components with eigenvalues larger than one were retained for further analysis,
and the components explaining the largest amount of common variance in the tree-ring
chronologies were included in a climate correlation analysis. The PCAs resulted in two potential
reconstructions: one covering the 1845-1981 interval, and one covering the 1750-1981 interval. Each
reconstruction has its own set of skill and accuracy statistics, as described in <a 
href="#x1-80002.5">2.5<!--tex4ht:ref: cal_ver --></a>. The final
reconstruction is a combination of segments from the two principal components: 1750-1844, and
1845-1981.

run for 100,000 iterations with a burn-in of 50,000. Parameter estimates were thinned so
that only every tenth estimate was saved to disk. The 0.025, 0.5 and 0.975 quantiles of these
estimated were determined to define an upper and lower bound for a 95% credible interval, as
well as the median. At each iteration, parameter estimates were used to compute estimated
precipitation. A 95% predictive interval was computed from these precipitation estimates using the
0.025, 0.5 and 0.975 quantiles. Note that frequentist methods could have been used with
similar results, although we much prefer the simple interpretation of the Bayesian credible
interval.

<!--l. 339--><p class="noindent" >Based on this climate-growth analysis, mjPR and jjPDSI were considered as candidate targets for
reconstruction. An assessment of the calibration/verification statistics for a reconstruction
based on the BM chronology alone (results not shown), however, suggested that the climate

the BM chronology with four existing oak chronologies from nearby sites (Fig.&#x00A0;<a

href="#x1-120062">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:stackedChrons --></a>) in a
nested PCA approach. All four chronologies were significantly positively correlated with the
mjPR and jjPDSI values from the monthly data set obtained from the spatial correlation
analysis.
<!--l. 350--><p class="noindent" >The first PC axis (PC1) of a PCA performed on all five chronologies for the period of overlap 1845-1981
explained 57.0% of the common variance, while the second axis explained 15.2%. All oak chronologies
had the same sign on PC1, thus emphasizing the correspondence between the time series. We then
performed another PCA including only the three chronologies which extended back to the year 1750
(LH, WD, OC). PC1 over this longer period explained 56.0% of the common variance and PC2 explained
28.3%. We then merged the PC1 time series of the two PC analyses (which were strongly positively
correlated; <span

chronology extending from 1750 to 1981. This chronology will from hereon be named SWV (for
southwest Virginia).
<!--l. 363--><p class="noindent" >When comparing SWV with monthly climate variables, we generally find higher correlations than for
the individually contributing tree-ring series (Fig.&#x00A0;<a

(<span

reconstruction targets in a split calibration/verification scheme ([<a 
href="#Xfritts1990methods">39</a>]; Table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-120005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: table:reconStats --></a>). RE and CE values
were negative for jjPDSI when using the later calibration period (1942-1981), indicating a
poor fit of the reconstruction model. RE and CE are key statistics to determine the skill of a
reconstruction, and our decision to reconstruct mjPR rather than jjPDSI was based on these values.
Our final mjPR reconstruction, now referred to as rSWV, was calibrated against the entire
1901-1981 interval. Estimates of rSWV and corresponding 95% predictive intervals were
computed for each year of the period of reconstruction using posterior parameter draws
(Fig.&#x00A0;<a

 id="x1-110004"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 390--><p class="noindent" >We investigated the relationship between climate and annual radial growth of chestnut oak growing at a
closed canopy site in the southeastern US. After removing the portion of the signal attributed to stand
dynamics and intrinsic age trends, we found that early summer (May through June) moisture was the
strongest, positive influence on radial growth. Similar climate-growth relationships have been
identified by previous studies on oak in the southeastern US [<a 
href="#Xspeer2009climate">15</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xli2011dendroclimatic">40</a>] and can be explained by
ecophysiological mechanisms. Radial growth of oak species typically starts in April or May
after leaf-out, and even in years with adequate moisture, is 90% complete by the end of July
[<a 
href="#Xrobertson1992factors">41</a>]. In the first months of the growing season, carbon is allocated predominantly to radial
thickening, while later in the season the focus of this allocation is shifted to carbohydrate
storage [<a 
href="#Xzweifel2006intra">42</a>]. Under severe moisture stress, oak carbon allocation is shifted from shoot to root,
thereby increasing the root/shoot ratio [<a 
href="#Xdickson1996oak">43</a>]. Chestnut oak is considered to be more tolerant to
drought stress than other oak species and exhibits several morphological adaptations in order
to better cope with moisture stress events [<a 
href="#Xdickson1996oak">43</a>]. However, we found that its radial growth
was strongly influenced by moisture availability, suggesting that in years with inadequate
moisture, radial growth is not a priority and carbon allocation is likely focused on maintenance
or root development. The identifiable moisture-response in the detrended BM chronology
demonstrates that oaks in a closed-canopy forest can indeed be used as paleoclimate proxies, if the
non-climatic portion of the low-frequency signal in the tree-ring time series is removed with great
care [<a 
href="#Xcook1985time">44</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xcook1990tree">45</a>]. The development of a biologically motivated trend removal algorithm may
improve current practices in dendroclimatology [<a 
href="#Xmelvin2008signal">46</a>]. In addition, care must be taken in closed
canopy forests when attempting to use growth series as proxy records as younger stands in
the stem-exclusion phase may be dominated by the effects of competition rather than of
climate[<a 
href="#Xoliver1980forest">47</a>].
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 426--><p class="noindent" >To isolate and strengthen the moisture-growth relationship of the BM chronology, we performed a
nested PCA including five regional summer moisture sensitive <span 
class="pplri9e-x-x-109">Quercus </span>chronologies. The spatial pattern
of the relationship between the resulting SWV chronology and early summer precipitation <a 
href="#x1-120084">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:precipCorrMap --></a> indicates
that SWV is positively correlated with moisture in the Great Appalachian Valley. Mountains play an
important role in the hydrological cycle for several reasons, one of which being that they are the points
of origin of most rivers [<a 
href="#Xbeniston1997climatic">48</a>]. Increases in precipitation in mountainous regions leads to increased stream
flow volumes and surface runoff, which in turn increases soil moisture in the Appalachian
watershed.
<!--l. 438--><p class="noindent" >Our reconstruction generally shows similar variability as other reconstructions of moisture
variability in the southeastern US (Table&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-120033">3<!--tex4ht:ref: table:reconComps --></a>), in particular with a regional reconstruction of
summer PDSI (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-120117">7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:reconCompare --></a>). The strongest similarity was found with the NADA PDSI Cook
reconstruction, although we note the lack of full independence between these two records.
Despite the overall strong agreement between both records, a 31-year windowed correlation
between rSWV and NADA PDSI indicated that these records were not consistent for the period
1853-1866.
<!--l. 448--><p class="noindent" >All five chronologies contributing to SWV show a pattern of reduced correlation with the NADA PDSI
reconstruction during this period, which coincides with a La Niña event which occurred
from 1855-1863 [<a 
href="#Xcole2002multiyear">49</a>]. La Niña events typically have stronger impacts on the West Coast, but
can also have effects on weather patterns throughout North America, and have even been
shown to affect the Atlantic hurricane season [<a 
href="#Xpielke1999nina">50</a>]. During this large-scale ocean-atmosphere
phenomenon, abnormal temperatures increases in the southeastern US in combination with low
moisture availability likely led to a change in the otherwise stationary precipitation-growth
relationship.
<!--l. 459--><p class="noindent" >The rSWV reconstruction showed anomalies consistent with the instrumental precipitation record for
1901-1981 <a 
href="#x1-120073">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:climCorr --></a>. In particular, the reconstruction correctly identifies the severe nation-wide dust bowl era
drought in the 1930s as well as the drought year 1956, the single worst drought year of the 1950s
drought [<a 
href="#Xfye2003paleoclimatic">51</a>]. In years prior to the instrumental record, the SWV reconstruction identifies several dry
periods: 1760-1776, 1867-1874, and 1894-1902.
<!--l. 486--><p class="noindent" >The rSWV reconstruction shows an 11-year cyclicity (<a 
href="#x1-120106">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:spectral --></a>), a periodicity that has been observed in both
instrumental and paleo-reconstructed temperature and moisture indices, such as the Northern
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
Hemisphere annual average land air temperature record extending from 1951-1980, the Northen
Hemisphere annual temperature anomalies reconstructed from proxy data for 1579 1880, as well as for
many of the contiguous states using state-averaged instrumental temperature and precipitation records
[<a 
href="#Xhancock1979cross">52</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xlassen1995variability">53</a>]. In particular, this cyclic pattern has been identified in June precipitation in the south-eastern
US [<a 
href="#Xhancock1979cross">52</a>], but was not apparent in western US tree-ring based PDSI reconstructions [<a 
href="#Xcook1997new">54</a>]. This observed
11-year periodicity is a characteristic of the solar cycle, which has been shown to be reflected in
terrestrial climate, and identified as one of the contributing factors that determine global temperature
[<a 
href="#Xlassen1995variability">53</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xreid2002solar">55</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xnational1994Solar">56</a>]. Solar periods of high and low activity can be measured by the number of sunspots or the
solar cycle length [<a 
href="#Xfriis1991length">57</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xusoskin2003millennium">58</a>]. A larger number of sunspots indicates greater solar activity, and the
magnetic fields in these sunspots have the ability to release large amount of stored energy as
solar flares or coronal mass ejections. These changes in released energy in turn affect the
realized weather patterns. Studies have shown that these changes in released energy may
also influence hydroclimate [<a 
href="#Xhancock1979cross">52</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xnichols2012hydroclimate">59</a>]. However, despite the presence of strong correlations
between terrestrial climate records and solar cycles, physical mechanisms which explain the
effects of external solar forcing on global circulation patterns have yet to be fully understood
[<a 
href="#Xfranks2002assessing">60</a>].
<!--l. 514--><p class="noindent" >In conclusion, we have shown that the growth of chestnut oak in the southern Appalachians is positively
influenced by early summer precipitation. This appears to be a regional trend, as the growth of several
other oak chronologies was strongly associated with our chronology. We also successfully reconstructed
May-June precipitation for 150 years prior to the instrumental record (1750-1981). Extending the climate
record will allow scientists to have more information as to how climate affects tree growth and shapes
ecosystems. This will better prepare us for predicting future vegetation changes that may occur with a
changing climate.
