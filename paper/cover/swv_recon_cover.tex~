\opening{Dear Dr. Schimel,} 
 
I am writing to submit our manuscript entitled ``Predicting white spruce mortality from retrospective data: competition versus recent growth'' for consideration for publication as an article in Ecological Applications. This work advances both sampling methodology as well as our understanding of mixedwood spruce mortality processes. 

We use a retrospective sampling scheme to obtain annual resolution forest inventory data. These methods use dendrochronological techniques and allow us to efficiently fill the existing white spruce data gap in Alberta. Using this annually-resolved data set, we further our understanding of mixedwood forest demography by characterizing the predictors of white spruce mortality. We develop and compare two mortality models based on two groups of predictors: local competition and recent growth. We find that local competition is almost as effective as recent growth at predicting mortality. In addition, we confirm the importance of early summer moisture availability for spruce survival. Our annual spruce mortality rate estimate is in accordance with results from previous work based on limited data.

We confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. All authors have approved the manuscript and in support of submission to Ecological Applications.

We look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. Please address all correspondence to andria.dawson@gmail.com, as indicated on Ecotrack.

\closing{Sincerely,}
